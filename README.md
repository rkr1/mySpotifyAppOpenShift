# mySpotifyApp on OpenShift
This is the same as rkr1/mySpotifyApp with settings to run on OpenShift.

## Details
Webhooks automatically cause OpenShift to rebuild and redeploy the code on every GitHub push event.

The Spotify client_id and client_secret are set as environment variables within my OpenShift account.

As of Feb 2018, it is running here:
http://myspotifyapp-myproj.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com

It requires a Spotify account to login.

## Notes
This is an interview project.  It is not complete.

It looks better on Chrome.
